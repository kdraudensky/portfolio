Chase and the Catdaddiez - Project Log

Thurs. 11/14/13:
	Group Meeting - (2 hours)
		-Today we had our first group meeting; all members were present
		We discussed ideas and structure of the project, prepared the
		project proposal, and decided on a team name. We established
		each member's strengths and weaknesses and began thinking about
		task assignment.
		
Sun. 11/17/13
	Group Meeting (4 hours)
		-Today we set up the git, planned out the structure of our game
		using a case diagram, and began assigning specific tasks to
		individual members. Chase has already created many of the
		necessary files and written legitimate chunks of code to start
		the base for much of our work.

	Open Tasks:

	- Implement Timings            => Chase
	- Implement Control Passing    => Chase
	- Implement D/V/A Routines     => Sean
	- Implement Collisions         => Sean
	- Implement MusicController    => Joe
	- Get Graphics                 => All
	- Establish Level File Format  => Kyle
	- Create States                => Not Yet Assigned

	Accomplished Tasks:

	- Establish MV Controller Framework
	- Establish Graphics/Drawing Model
	- Create base class model

	Milestones:

	*Milestone 1: First screen of SMB*

	- Test drawing/updating
	- Test physics/collisions/movement
	- Test level importer
	- Test screen scroll
	- Test music/sound effects
	- Test mushroom
	- Test goomba


Wed. 11/20/13
	Group Meeting (1.5 hours)
		-Today we met to discuss how each team member is doing with their assigned
		part(s) of the project. We spent much of the time discussing how to
		implement a level reader to turn a level text file into an actual level
		model.

	Kyle began writing code for this in the Level.java file but it is not fully
	complete yet.
	
Sun. 11/24/13
	Group Meeting (4 hours)
	-We met to check in with our individual progress and work on more as well.
		-Sean is pretty much finished with collisions, we just need to finish up some other
		components of the project before we can officially test it.
		
		-Joe is mostly finished up with the music controller as well, and it is ready to be
		implemented by the other classes in our project.
		
		-Kyle created classes for the objects we still need for the actual game and
		finished the level reader, the only thing missing is that we don't yet have
		the object classes completely done so the level reader cannot yet create instances
		of them when necessary.
		
		-Chase completed work in several areas including the game class, object model
		design, some state model and mainGame work, graphics scaling/drawing, cutting
		out sprite graphics, TimingController, and Mario.
		
Tues. 12/3/13
	Group Meeting (2 hours)
	-Today we continued work on the actual level board and gameplay. Chase and Sean worked
	on collisions and mario's actual movements while Kyle and Joe worked on incorporating
	sound clips, a bit of graphics work, and inserting objects into the board.
	
	Challenges as of now:
		-Our collisions, mario's movements, and overall physics of the game need lots of
		work before we can get the game fully functional
		-Our sound/music is very large and takes up tons of memory, we need to work on this
		-We still haven't gotten to a point where we can work on the structure of the game
		including main menu, options, a full set of levels, score counters, etc.
		
Sat. 12/7/13
	Meeting: Kyle and Chase (6 hours)
	We worked together and made significant progress on the gameplay and the
	implementation of mario, his movements, and animations for events in the game.
	
Sun. 12/8/13
	Group Meeting (16 hours)
	LOTS of work done today, pretty much finished the project minus some features to be
	added and a few bugs that need worked out before submission. Sean and Chase fixed
	jumping and Sean fixed collisions (mostly). Kyle wrote the real levels, made mario die
	correctly, wrote interactions for items, and made mario's running animated. Kyle and
	Chase created all animations and behavior for changing powerUp states for mario. Sean
	wrote animations for all enemies and their behaviors. Joe fixed sound bugs when needed,
	including making mp3s compatible in the library and fixing music pause during pause menu.
	Chase made the pause menu work (at some point) and also created a title screen as well
	as loading the next level when the end of the previous one is reached. Chase drew up
	the presentation slides and we all figured out who would discuss what for the
	presentation. 
	
Mon. 12/9/13
	Group Meeting (2 hours)
	We met today just to wrap up the remaining tasks and split up the responsibilities. Kyle
	wrote the readme.txt file, Joe wrote the user manual, Chase is writing some of the tech
	manual but will receive help from all eventually. Sean organized all the files into packages,
	and everyone helped with commenting their code and citing sources.
